# Queues
SimPy simulation examples for simple queueing systems.

This github repository was created to provide teaching examples for Final Year Project students at the Department of Eletrical Engineering, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.

1. Installing Python and SimPy
These examples are written in Python 3.
The recommended method for installing Python is via the Windows Store (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7) or via apt on Linux (sudo apt install python3). 
Packages such as SimPy can be installed using the pip command:

pip install simpy
Note some libraries such as random are included with base Python and do not need to be installed with pip.
